# Introduction

This project is inspired by the French Minitel from the 1980s. Minitel was a precursor to the World Wide Web and was wildly used and successful. The service was available publically thoughout France and through the portal, users had access to various services such as making train reservations, checking stock prices, among other things. My "Service Portal" aims to mimic some of those features.

# Vision

Given the open-endedness of this project, my hope is to make continual additions and improvements to the various features. The ultimate goal is a "functional product" with well-written code.

# Current Features and Abilities

- Main Access Portal
- Bank Access (Deposit, Withsdraw, Customer Details, Total Deposits, Total Withsdraws)
